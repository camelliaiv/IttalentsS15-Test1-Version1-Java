# Ittalents, Test 1, Version 1, Java
Task №1: Write a program that reads 3 characters separated by space – each one – the value of a slot machine. Possible inputs are all capital letters. The inputs are infinite. The program must check whether there is a “BINGO” combination – three instances of the same value in a single input. If there is a BINGO combination, the output must be BINGO and the program continues. The program stops when all BINGO combinations have been dealt at least once. Then the program should print the total number of tries. Invalid inputs are not considered a valid try.


Task №2: Write a function that takes a varible that holds some text. The function must print all the words that are part of other words in the same text. For example ‘me’ is a part of ‘men’.


Task №3: Write a method that by given array of integers, returns another array of 4 in- tegers, that are – the sum, the substraction, the product and the division of all elements in the given array. Use recursion!


Task №4: Write a method that takes a 2D square array of characters with odd number of rows and columns, slice it by two diagonals and prints the two triangles that are left. Triangles are printed one after another (not next to each other)
